Term Project Description
Project Management System

1 Objective
The objective of this project is to apply software engineering best practices to develop a Project Management application in an iterative and time-boxed manner. With each iteration, a new increment of the Project Management application must be specified, modeled, built, tested and presented.

The focus of the project is on learning the software process and the inter-relatedness of the activities in a project. The process emphasizes:

 test-driven development, to ensure good understanding of requirements, and working software;
 agile development, to encourage iteration, to divide the work into small chunks, and to allow students to improve their skills from one iteration to the next;
 object-oriented software development, in particular software systems as collections of collaborating objects, with a focus on responsibility-driven design, an emphasis of separating interfaces from implementations, and the use of patterns; and 
 communication, by being team-based, and requiring basic documentation using UML for domain model, use cases, architecture and design, and testing.

2 Project Description and Expected Features
Your team has been hired to develop a Project Management application to help project managers and project members to model and analyze the various activities and resources involved in their projects via a graphical user interface (GUI). A preliminary interaction with your client determined that the application shall support the following user stories and constraints:

User Stories:
US 1: As a project manager, I want to manage all my projects with the application.
US 2: As a project manager, I want to associate multiple interdependent activities with my project.
US 3: As a project manager, I want to assign resources (project members) and project-relevant properties to my activities.
US 4: As a project member, I want to be able to see which tasks have been assigned to me.
US 5: As a project manager, I want to generate GANTT charts.
US 6: As a project manager, I want to perform a critical path analysis.
US 7: As a project manager, I want to be able to perform PERT analysis.
US 8: As a project manager, I want to be able to perform earned value analysis.

Constraints:
 Standalone JAVA application
 JAVA SWING GUI
 SQLite DB

3 Team Formation and Oragnization
The project is team-based. Each team consists of approximately 6 students and is organized into three subteams of size 2 to 3. There are three roles on the project:

Developer: should produce working source code
Tester: creates test cases, codes unit tests, and runs unit tests to check all is working 
Documenter: should produce the documentation and specications, but the content for the document is the joint responsibility of the team

Each subteam assumes the role of either developer, tester or documenter for the duration of an iteration. Team members rotate their roles such that each subteam will play each of the three roles.

It is important to understand that the project is a team effort and that it may be required to "loan" members from one subteam to another in order to meet the deadline. Note thatthere exist strong dependencies between the subteams. For example, testers need to talk to developers to know the class interfaces, and the expected results of each method.

Every team is responsible for establishing "ground rules" in order to minimize conicts. In order to ensure on-time delivery, the internal delivery schedule should allow sufficient "slack" for mistakes and re-work. It is recommended to assign tasks as early as possible, so individuals can schedule their other work.

4 Development Environment
The following standard development tools shall be used:
 Java as the programming language;
 Eclipse as the integrated development environment (IDE);
 JUnit for unit testing in Java; and
 Rational Rose for UML modeling.

5 Project Plan and Deliverables
The Project Management application is to be developed in three iterations. Each iteration will produce a running system. Starting with a set of core features, with each iteration additional features will be added and/or the implementation of existing features will be
modified. Each iteration will take three to four weeks. Each iteration will have a document as a deliverable: a requirements document, a design document, and a test plan and report respectively for iteration one, two, and three. Each iteration will have source code as a deliverable including unit tests.

Submission dates for the three iterations are in week 5, week 9, and week 12 of semester. Exact deadlines for submission to the EAS (Electronic Assignment Submission) system are listed on the course web page. Your team will be required to do a preliminary presentation of your system and document in the lab one week prior to submission. There will be a formal presentation of your
submission in the lab following the submission deadline.

Iteration 1
User Stories: US 1, US 2.
Document: Software requirements specication (for all user stories). Each team will be responsible to independently rene the user stories into software requirements. (Your team is your customer)

Iteration 2
User Stories: US 3, US 4, US 5.
Document: Architectural and detailed design specication (for all user stories)

Iteration 3
User Stories: US 6, US 7, US 8.
Document: Test plan and test report
